# Bank_Search_Application
A single page web app built using ReactJS. The app should list and search for banks that are fetched from the API mentioned below. There should be a dropdown for cities (just put in 5 cities in there) and there is a search bar. As I type in the search area, the table should be dynamically filtered (client-side filtering). Search should be across all fields.

## Requirements of the application: 
1.	bank search screen which would show a list of banks
2.	user should be able to search by text for the banks, across all the fields (important: there would be no search button)
3.	pagination for the results of the search, the user should be able to select page size
4.	mark some banks as favourites. View banks that were marked as favourites (favourites should persist state event if the website is refreshed or reloaded)
5.	API calls should be cached
